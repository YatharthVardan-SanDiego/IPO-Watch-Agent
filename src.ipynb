    "### Core Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "**filings.py** - SEC Filing Extraction\n",
    "- Extracts HTML content from SEC submission files\n",
    "- Navigates complex SEC EDGAR file structure\n",

    "\n",
    "**ipo_score.py** - Multi-Agent Analysis System\n",
    "- Financial Analysis Agent: Evaluates revenue, profitability, growth\n",
    "- Risk Analysis Agent: Identifies and grades risk factors\n",
    "- Business Analysis Agent: Analyzes business model and impact\n",
    "- Final Scoring Agent: Synthesizes analyses into investment recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "**workflow.py** - Pipeline Orchestrator\n",
    "- Manages end-to-end workflow\n",

    "#### Limitations for the project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the retriver to understand the content of entire S1 filing , it takes about 30 minutes to ingest new companies in the retriever\n",
    "2. Hence for the purpose of this run the companies data is pre loaded in the retriever. \n",
    "3. The NEWS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - turned out be a major blocker for implementation, for any API used there was always a limit on the content which did not allow any good sentiment to be performed \n",
    "<b>4. Hence for this project - the analysis of the IPO will be on the basis of S1 filing and the information provided in the file."

    "   - Fetches companies that filed IPOs in specified period\n",
    "   - Returns company list with names, symbols, dates\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Download S-1 Filings** (`download_s1_filings()`)\n",
    "   - Uses `sec_edgar_downloader` library\n",

    "#### Phase 2: Data Processing\n",
    "4. **Extract & Ingest** (`ingest_s1_files_in_retriever()`)\n",
    "   - Uses `filings.py` to extract HTML from submission files\n",
    "   - Converts HTML to plain text\n",
    "   - Chunks text using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`\n",
    "   - Generates embeddings and stores in Chroma vector database\n",
    "   - **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Takes ~30 minutes per company\n",

       "  'score_summary': '\\n Based on the provided information, I would rate the IPO as \"GOOD\" for investment. Here\\'s a brief explanation of my reasoning:\\n\\n Financials: The company has a strong track record of profitability, with a net income of $1,481,254 in the two and five months ended May 31, 2023. Its commitment to investing in technology and innovation positions it well for future growth. However, the company does face risks related to the complexity and fragmentation of the healthcare insurance market, as well as the potential for reputational harm due to negative publicity or cyber-attacks. Overall, I believe that the company\\'s financials are strong and that it has significant growth potential in the future.\\n\\n Risks: While there are several risks facing the company, such as its reliance on insurance carriers and the potential for reputational harm, the company has a strong understanding of the complexities of the healthcare insurance market and has developed technology platforms that streamline and simplify the offering, underwriting, and closing processes for self-funded benefits plans and stop loss insurance programs. Additionally, the company has made significant investments to further market, develop, and expand its business, including by continuing to develop its technology platforms, acquiring more members, maintaining existing members, and investing in partnerships, collaborations, and acquisitions.\\n\\n Business: HIT offers a unique value proposition by providing self-funded benefits plans and stop loss insurance to small businesses through a digital platform that integrates the complex aspects of the healthcare insurance market. The company\\'s technology platforms automate, digitalize, and simplify the process for brokers, TPAs, and other third-party agents to quote, bind, and issue medical stop loss insurance policies. HIT has experienced significant growth in its network of brokers, TPAs, and other third-party agents, which is critical to its success.\\n\\n Overall, I believe that the company\\'s strong financials, understanding of the healthcare insurance market, and commitment to investing in technology and innovation make it a good investment opportunity. However, it is important to note that there are risks facing the company, such as its reliance on insurance carriers and the potential for reputational harm, and these should be carefully considered before making any investment decisions.'},\n",

The risks associated with the company\\'s dependence on the development and commercialization of its cancer drugs, particularly ON01910, are high, and there is a devastating risk of failure in these trials or in the market. Additionally, the company is subject to changing laws and regulations that may increase both its costs and the risk of non-compliance. Furthermore, the company has not yet generated any revenue or profits and faces significant risks and uncertainties in identifying and consummating a business combination, which could potentially result in a loss of investment for its shareholders.\\n\\nThe financial position of the company is also rated as \"Bad\" due to the fact that it has not yet generated any revenue or profits and has only raised capital through an IPO. The company\\'s search for a business combination may also be materially adversely affected by current global geopolitical conditions, which could further negatively impact its financial position.\\n\\nOverall, the high risks associated with the company\\'s dependence on cancer drug development and the uncertainty of its ability to identify and consummate a successful business combination make it a poor investment choice.

Additionally, the company may face risks related to technology acquisitions, liquidity challenges due to the current global situation, and competition for deals in out-of-favor markets.\\n\\nFurthermore, the company's financial information is not provided, which makes it difficult to assess its current financial health or growth potential. The risk grade for the company is 'Bad', indicating that it may face additional and distinctive risks if it acquires a business in certain industries, such as technology, which could be detrimental to the company and the business it acquires.\\n\\nOverall, based on the information provided, this IPO appears to have a higher level of risk and uncertainty compared to other investment opportunities, and therefore would not be considered a good investment.\"},\n",

The company's impact has been successful in terms of growth, expansion, awards, and scale.\\n\\nHowever, the company is subject to adverse United States federal income tax consequences as a passive foreign investment company (PFIC), which is a 'Bad' risk.

Risks: The company faces significant risks, including reliance on a limited number of customers, market conditions impacting its ability to achieve financial and operational metrics, and potential disruptions due to armed conflict, political instability, or civil unrest in oil and gas producing regions. These risks increase the likelihood of non-payment or payment delays from customers and disruptions to operations, which could negatively impact the company\\'s financial performance.\\n2. Financials: The company has experienced a decline in revenue and had a net loss, indicating a negative financial position. This suggests that the company may not have sufficient resources to invest in its business or meet its financial obligations, which could further exacerbate its risks.\\n3. Business: The company\\'s hedging strategy and results, competition, and government regulations could all have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, negative public perception towards the oil and gas industry may limit its access to capital funding, damage its reputation, and adversely impact its business.\\n\\nOverall, based on these factors, I would rate the INR IPO as \"Bad\" for investment due to the high risks and negative financial position faced by the company.'}]"
